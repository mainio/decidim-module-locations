    # This concern can be added in any other command that updates record
    # locations. For example, if you want to update the record locations in
    # UpdateRecord command, you should do the following:
    #
    # 1. Include the Decidim::Locations::LocationsForm concern to the record
    #    form class
    # 2. Add the locations input to the record form view (see README)
    # 3. Include this concern to the UpdateRecord command
    # 4. After the record is updated, call `update_locations(locatable, form)`
