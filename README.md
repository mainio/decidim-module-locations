# Decidim::Locations

The gem has been developed by [Mainio Tech](https://www.mainiotech.fi/).

A [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim) module that provides the
possibility to add multiple locations to any technical records. Right now this
is really simple and requires manually writing the latitude/longitude values to
fulfill a data storage need.

This is a technical module that adds this ability to Decidim but the locations
functionality needs to be manually added to the individual models, the
location input needs to be added to the editing views and the locations display
needs to be added to the record views. This module provides you all the tools to
add these elements to the user interface.

Development of this gem has been sponsored by the
[City of Helsinki](https://www.hel.fi/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "decidim-locations"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rails decidim_locations:install:migrations
```

## Usage

Add this to the model you want to attach locations to:

```ruby
class YourModel < ApplicationRecord
  include Decidim::Locations::Locatable
  # ...
end
```

Add this to the form classes in which you want to allow adding locations to the
records:

```ruby
class YourModelForm < Decidim::Form
  include Decidim::Locations::LocatableForm
end
```

Include this cell inside the record's editing form:

```erb
<%= decidim_form_for(@model_form) do |form| %>
  <% # ... other form fields ... %>
  <%== cell("decidim/locations/form", form, label: t(".locations_label")) %>
  <% # ... other form fields ... %>
<% end %>
```

And finally, inside the commands that create and update the records, include
the following:

```ruby
class YourUpdateCommand < Rectify::Command
  # Add this concern to the command
  include Decidim::Locations::LocationsCommand

  def initialize(form, model)
    @form = form
    @model = model
  end

  def call
    return broadcast(:invalid) if @form.invalid?

    # Here you would normally update the record
    @model.update!(foo: form.foo, bar: form.bar)

    # AFTER the record has been updated, call the update_locations method with
    # the model and the form objects. The form object needs to have the
    # Decidim::Locations::LocatableForm concern included as explained above.
    update_locations(@model, @form)

    broadcast(:ok, @model)
  end
end
```

If you want the locations to be also available through the GraphQL API, you will
also need to add the following to the relevant GraphQL types:

```ruby
class YourModelType < Decidim::Api::Types::BaseObject
  description "Your model"
  # ...
  implements Decidim::Locations::LocationsInterface
  # ...
end
```

After this, you will have the `locations` field available through the GraphQL
API for your models.

### Usage example: Proposals

In order to apply what is explained above for the proposals component, you can
do the following:

#### 1. Add an initializer to apply the customizations to the classes

In your Decidim application, create a new initializer file, e.g.
`config/initializers/decidim_locations.rb`. Add the following contents to that
file:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Decidim::Proposals::Proposal.include Decidim::Locations::Locatable
  Decidim::Proposals::ProposalForm.include Decidim::Locations::LocatableForm
  Decidim::Proposals::ProposalType.implements Decidim::Locations::LocationsInterface
end
```

Now you have just applied most of the described changes except the user
interface part to the proposals component.

#### 2. Customize the views

The next thing is to add the locations fields to your user interface. For the
proposals component this can be done by editing
`app/views/decidim/proposals/proposals/_edit_form_fields.html.erb`. In order to
customize any views in Decidim, please refer to the official documentation about
[customizing views](https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/customize/views.html).

In that view, in the appropriate place where you would normally display the
address field, add the following code:

```erb
<%== cell("decidim/locations/form", form, label: t(".locations_label")) %>
```

#### 3. Customize the form

After the user interface field is added, you still need to take it into account
when you are updating the proposal records. This happens by customizing
`app/commands/decidim/proposals/update_proposal.rb` as described
earlier in this documentation. To learn more about customizing any logic in
Decidim, please refer to the
[official documentation](https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/customize/logic).

The change you need to do in the command class is the following within the
`call` method:

```ruby
def call
  # ... normal stuff from the proposals module ...
  # ADD THIS LINE:
  update_locations(proposal, form)

  # ... the rest from the proposals module ...
  broadcast(:ok, proposal)
end
```

## Contributing

See [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim).

### Developing

To start contributing to this project, first:

- Install the basic dependencies (such as Ruby and PostgreSQL)
- Clone this repository

Decidim's main repository also provides a Docker configuration file if you
prefer to use Docker instead of installing the dependencies locally on your
machine.

You can create the development app by running the following commands after
cloning this project:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake development_app
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

Then to test how the module works in Decidim, start the development server:

```bash
$ cd development_app
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rails s
```

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add the environment variables to the root directory of the project in a file
named `.rbenv-vars`. If these are defined for the environment, you can omit
defining these in the commands shown above.

#### Code Styling

Please follow the code styling defined by the different linters that ensure we
are all talking with the same language collaborating on the same project. This
project is set to follow the same rules that Decidim itself follows.

[Rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/) linter is used for the Ruby language.

You can run the code styling checks by running the following commands from the
console:

```
$ bundle exec rubocop
```

To ease up following the style guide, you should install the plugin to your
favorite editor, such as:

- Atom - [linter-rubocop](https://atom.io/packages/linter-rubocop)
- Sublime Text - [Sublime RuboCop](https://github.com/pderichs/sublime_rubocop)
- Visual Studio Code - [Rubocop for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/misogi/vscode-ruby-rubocop)

### Testing

To run the tests run the following in the gem development path:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake test_app
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rspec
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add these environment variables to the root directory of the project in a
file named `.rbenv-vars`. In this case, you can omit defining these in the
commands shown above.

### Test code coverage

If you want to generate the code coverage report for the tests, you can use
the `SIMPLECOV=1` environment variable in the rspec command as follows:

```bash
$ SIMPLECOV=1 bundle exec rspec
```

This will generate a folder named `coverage` in the project root which contains
the code coverage report.
